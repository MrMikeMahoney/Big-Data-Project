# Big-Data-Project
Project for Big Data >> IS_6733

This was the final project for Big Data IS-6733 with professor Paul Rad (Peyman Najafirad).  This project used the "young people survey" >> https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey >> The data contains 1010 observations across 150 columns, with each response on a 5 point scale: 1-Stongly Disagree, 2-Slightly Disagree, 3- Nuetral, 4-Slightly Agree, 5-Stongly Agree >> with the columns composing of:
  Music preferences (19 items)
  Movie preferences (12 items)
  Hobbies & interests (32 items)
  Phobias (10 items)
  Health habits (3 items)
  Personality traits, views on life, & opinions (57 items)
  Spending habits (7 items)
  Demographics (10 items) >> These are not on a 5 point scale and contain binary and continuous data

My team and I built a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to attempt to classify and predict preferences of one category using the other categories.

My specific portion was predicting phobias, using the other categories.  In the "Young Clusta" power point, my specific portion consisted of slides 10-15.  I also contributed to data cleaning and building several versions of the DNN.

The Young Clusta team: Mike Mahoney, Tyler Price, Nathan Shepherd

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy it,
